# Experiments to be conducted in the future

### Relationship between Canyon-Forest-Sandbox and corresponding Almost-Collision data

| Model trained on | Perspective lines | Vertical lines | Strange shapes |
|------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Canyon           |                   |                |                |
| Forest           |                   |                |                |
| Sandbox          |                   |                |                |

### Influence of training in different order: canyon -> forest -> sandbox vs canyon -> canyon+forest -> sandbox+canyon+forest
